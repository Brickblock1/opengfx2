#opengfx2

Work-in-progress / development repo for an "OpenGFX v2". Or maybe that should be refactored OpenGFX, or perhaps an OpenGFX extra zoom. Or some combination of all of them. Not quite sure yet!

Partially derived directly from OpenGFX, partly redrawn or revised from original 32bpp sources.

Better organised, automated composite sprite generation and drawn with extra zoom levels in mind.

Requires git lfs for large file management.
